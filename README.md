Movie-Ticket-Booking-System
This Online Movie Ticket Booking System is a full-stack DBMS project developed using Python (Streamlit) for the frontend and MySQL for backend data storage. 
It allows users to register, log in, browse movies, select seats, make payments, and view booking confirmations, all through an interactive web interface. 
Admins can log in to a dedicated dashboard to manage movies, track bookings, and oversee user activity. 
The project emphasizes real-world database management concepts like user authentication, data access control, relational schema design, and SQL query execution. This application showcases seamless integration between a Python-based UI and relational database operations demonstrating database-driven web application development.
